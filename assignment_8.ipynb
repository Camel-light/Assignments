        "\n",
        "1. What problem does collaborative filtering solve?\n",
        "\n",
        "*Collaborative filtering solves the problem of predicting the interests of users based on the interests of other users and recommending items based on these interests. The key idea of collaborative filtering is latent factors. Collaborative filtering is a technique that’s used by recommendation systems to predict items a user might like based on the ratings the user has given in the past and the ratings of other users with similar tastes*\n",
        "2. How does it solve it?\n",
        "\n",
        "*Collaborative filtering solves the problem of predicting the interests of users based on the interests of other users and recommending items based on these interests by using latent factors.*\n",
        "3. Why might a collaborative filtering predictive model fail to be a very useful recommendation system?\n",
        "\n",
        "*A collaborative filtering predictive model might fail to be a very useful recommendation system due to the following reasons:*\n",
        "\n",
        "*Cold Start: A problem that happens when the recommendation system doesn’t have enough information about users or items to make good predictions. It happens with new communities that don’t have enough interactions.*\n",
        "\n",
        "*Lack of information about user preferences: When a collaborative filtering system is first created, it is often ineffective due to a lack of information about user preferences. This hinders the performance of this type of recommendation system and can cause it to be ineffective in situations with a small user base or with too many items2.*\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What does a crosstab representation of collaborative filtering data look like?\n",
        "\n",
        "*In the crosstab representation of collaborative filtering data, the users and items are the rows and columns (or vice versa) of a large matrix with the values filled out based on the user’s rating of the item.*\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Write the code to create a crosstab representation of the MovieLens data (you might need to do some web searching!).\n",
        "6. What is a latent factor? Why is it \"latent\"?\n",
        "\n",
        "*A latent factor is a variable that is not directly observed but is inferred from other variables that are observed. In collaborative filtering, latent factors are used to represent the characteristics of users and items that are not explicitly available in the data. The term “latent” is used because these factors are not directly observable but are inferred from the data.*\n",
        "7. What is a dot product? Calculate a dot product manually using pure Python with lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "*A dot product is a mathematical operation that takes two vectors and returns a scalar value. It is calculated by multiplying the corresponding elements of the two vectors and then summing the products.*\n",
        "\n",
        "*Here’s an example of how to calculate the dot product of two vectors using pure Python with lists:*\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "vector1 = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "```\n",
        "```\n",
        "vector2 = [4, 5, 6]\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "dot_product = sum([vector1[i] * vector2[i] for i in range(len(vector1))])```\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "```print(dot_product)```\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*This will output:*\n",
        "\n",
        "*32*\n",
        "8. What does `pandas.DataFrame.merge` do?\n",
        "*The pandas.DataFrame.merge() function is used to merge two or more dataframes into a single dataframe. It is similar to SQL join operations and can be used to combine data based on one or more common columns. The function provides several parameters that allow you to control the type of join, the columns to merge on, and how to handle missing values.*\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is an embedding matrix?\n",
        "*An embedding matrix is a matrix of weights that maps each word in a vocabulary to a vector of real numbers. The embedding matrix is used in natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as text classification and sentiment analysis. The matrix is typically initialized randomly and then learned during training using backpropagation. The size of the embedding matrix is determined by the number of words in the vocabulary and the number of dimensions in the vector space.*\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the relationship between an embedding and a matrix of one-hot-encoded vectors?\n",
        "*An embedding is a dense vector representation of a word that captures its meaning. In contrast, one-hot encoding is a sparse vector representation of a word that represents its presence or absence in a vocabulary. An embedding matrix maps each word in the vocabulary to an embedding vector, while a matrix of one-hot-encoded vectors maps each word to a sparse vector with only one non-zero element. The relationship between the two is that the embedding matrix can be used to transform one-hot-encoded vectors into dense embeddings.*\n",
        "\n",
        "11. Why do we need `Embedding` if we could use one-hot-encoded vectors for the same thing?\n",
        "\n",
        "*One-hot-encoded vectors are sparse and do not provide insight into the relationships between words. Word embeddings, on the other hand, provide a continuous and dense representation that can be used to measure similarity and distance between words. Embeddings can also capture the context of a word in a sentence or document. In addition, embeddings can be learned during training using backpropagation. This allows the model to learn the optimal representation for each word in the vocabulary.*\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What does an embedding contain before we start training (assuming we're not using a pretained model)?\n",
        "\n",
        "*An embedding matrix is a rank 2 tensor that contains rank 1 tensors that represent each user or item in the dataset. It stores weight values for the specified number of latent factors in each rank 1 tensor. The embedding layer will learn the word representations, along with the neural network while training and requires a lot of text data to provide accurate predictions.*\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Create a class (without peeking, if possible!) and use it.\n",
        "14. What does `x[:,0]` return?\n",
        "15. Rewrite the `DotProduct` class (without peeking, if possible!) and train a model with it.\n",
        "16. What is a good loss function to use for MovieLens? Why?\n",
        "\n",
        "*The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) can be used to evaluate performance on hold-out data. However, MovieLens uses star ratings (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) which are measured on an ordinal scale. MAE is more commonly used to evaluate performance continuous data*\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What would happen if we used cross-entropy loss with MovieLens? How would we need to change the model?\n",
        "18. What is the use of bias in a dot product model?\n",
        "\n",
        "*In a dot product model, bias is used to shift the activation function to the left or right, which can help improve the performance of the model.*\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What is another name for weight decay?\n",
        "\n",
        "*Weight decay is also known as L2 regularization because it penalizes weights according to their L2 norm.*\n",
        "\n",
        "20. Write the equation for weight decay (without peeking!).\n",
        "\n",
        "```L_new(w) = L_original(w) + λw^T w```\n",
        "\n",
        "*where λ is a value that determines the strength of the regularization.*\n",
        "21. Write the equation for the gradient of weight decay. Why does it help reduce weights?\n",
        "22. Why does reducing weights lead to better generalization?\n",
        "\n",
        "*Reducing weights leads to better generalization because it helps the neural networks to learn smoother/simpler functions which most of the time generalizes better compared to spiky, noisy ones.*\n",
        "\n",
        "23. What does `argsort` do in PyTorch?\n",
        "\n",
        "*In PyTorch, argsort() is used to sort a tensor along a given dimension. It returns the indices of the sorted elements along the given dimension in the form of a tensor*\n",
        "\n",
        "24. Does sorting the movie biases give the same result as averaging overall movie ratings by movie? Why/why not?\n",
        "\n",
        "*No, sorting the movie biases does not give the same result as averaging overall movie ratings by movie. The movie bias considers details about the movie other than its average rating. It takes into account the genres or actors or other factors.*\n",
        "\n",
        "25. How do you print the names and details of the layers in a model?\n",
        "\n",
        "*You can print the summary of a model in PyTorch using the following code:*\n",
        "\n",
        "`import torchsummary`\n",
        "\n",
        "`torchsummary.summary(model, input_size=(channels, H, W))`\n",
        "\n",
        "*This will print the names and details of the layers in a model.*\n",
        "\n",
        "26. What is the \"bootstrapping problem\" in collaborative filtering?\n",
        "\n",
        "*The bootstrapping problem in collaborative filtering refers to the problem of how to make recommendations for new users or items that have no ratings yet.*\n",
        "\n",
        "27. How could you deal with the bootstrapping problem for new users? For new movies?\n",
        "\n",
        "*One way to deal with the bootstrapping problem for new users is to use content-based filtering. This method uses the attributes of the items that the user has rated to recommend new items.*\n",
        "\n",
        "*Another way is to use collaborative filtering. Collaborative filtering uses similarities between users and items simultaneously to provide recommendations. This allows for serendipitous recommendations; that is, collaborative filtering models can recommend an item to user A even though no other users have rated both that item and user A’s other items.*\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "28. How can feedback loops impact collaborative filtering systems?\n",
        "\n",
        "*Feedback loops can impact collaborative filtering systems in various ways. For example, the feedback that the system receives can have a great impact over users’ interests and decision preference, and in turn influence the feedback that the system receives. This dynamic process is called a feedback loop.*\n",
        "\n",
        "29. When using a neural network in collaborative filtering, why can we have different numbers of factors for movies and users?\n",
        "\n",
        "*In collaborative filtering, we can have different numbers of factors for movies and users because they are different entities. The number of factors for movies and users can be different because they represent different things. For example, a user’s preferences may be influenced by many factors such as age, gender, occupation, etc., while a movie’s features may be influenced by other factors such as genre, director, actors, etc. Therefore, it makes sense to have different numbers of factors for movies and users.*\n",
        "\n",
        "30. Why is there an `nn.Sequential` in the `CollabNN` model?\n",
        "\n",
        "*The `nn.Sequential` in the `CollabNN` model is used to create a feedforward neural network. It is a container that holds other layers of the neural network. The `nn.Sequential` module allows us to create a neural network by stacking layers on top of each other. In this case, we are using it to stack fully connected layers on top of each other.*\n",
        "\n",
        "31. What kind of model should we use if we want to add metadata about users and items, or information such as date and time, to a collaborative filtering model?\n",
        "\n",
        "*If we want to add metadata about users and items, or information such as date and time, to a collaborative filtering model, we can use a hybrid recommender system. A hybrid recommender system combines two or more recommendation techniques to provide better recommendations. In this case, we can combine collaborative filtering with content-based filtering. Content-based filtering uses item features to recommend similar items. By combining these two techniques, we can create a more accurate and personalized recommendation system.*\n",
